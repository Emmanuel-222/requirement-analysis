# Requirement Analysis in Software Development


The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements.
In the Software Developmment Lifecycle it involves all of the steps needed to finalize the # functional(What a system should do?) and # non-functional(How that system perform?) requirement of a product.
